## Add circuit atlas and GitHub sync tooling

- New `/atlas` page: circuit, layer and anatomy views of all 807 cells and 21,161 measured edges, with per-cell, per-group and per-region panels that flag known modeling problems.
- `atlas-core.js` with node tests, and `test_atlas.py` route tests.
- `tools/setup_repo.sh` creates the GitHub repo; `tools/sync.sh` applies each downloaded iteration, runs tests, commits and pushes.
- `.gitignore` now excludes raw MaleCNS tables and `.DS_Store`.
- `CHANGES.md` added.

## Baseline: locomotion model and odor-learning lab

- Sparse LIF model on a MaleCNS locomotion subset driving an engineered six-leg readout.
- Trial-based odor-learning rate model on measured PN, KC, MBON and PAM cells.
